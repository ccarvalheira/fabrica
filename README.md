fabrica

Fabric scripts for deploying my thesis work.

After cloning but before using you must change the file api/btsync_blobstore.conf and insert a correct secret key.
You must also change the api/.env file to suit your particular deployment target.
I left the .env file there as it is more practical, but you propably don't want the same configurations.

Also, do not forget to keep the inventory.py file up to date with your particular inventory of machines!!
